## Ingrédients

* 1 cup quinoa
* 1 3/4 cups water
* Kosher salt
* 1 medium avocado
* 2 medium scallions
* 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
* 4 packed cups baby spinach (about 4 ounces)
* 4 large eggs
* 1 cup fermented red cabbage or beet kraut, such as Hawthorne Valley, Ozuké, or Atlantic Sea Farms
* 1 cup plain Greek yogurt
* 4 teaspoons hemp seeds

## Instructions

Préparation:

1. Rinse 1 cup quinoa, then place in a medium saucepan. Add 1 3/4 cups water and
   a generous pinch of kosher salt, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a
   simmer and cook uncovered until the quinoa is tender, 10 to 12 minutes.
   Remove from the heat, cover, and let steam for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, thinly
   slice 1 avocado and 2 medium scallions.
2. Heat 1 1/2 teaspoons of the olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium
   heat until shimmering. Add 4 packed cups baby spinach, and cook, tossing
   frequently, until wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Divide the spinach between 4 bowls
   and wipe the pan clean.
3. Heat the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil in the skillet over medium
   heat until shimmering. Add 4 large eggs and season each with a pinch of salt.
   Cook until the edges are crisp and the whites are set, about 2 minutes.
4. Divide the quinoa between the bowls and top with each with a fried egg.
   Divide 1 cup purple kraut, the avocado slices and scallions, 1 cup Greek
   yogurt, and 4 teaspoons hemp seeds among the bowls.
