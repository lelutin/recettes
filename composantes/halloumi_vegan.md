## Ingrédients

Donne TODO

* 350 g (16 oz) block firm of tofu
* 3 tablespoon nutritional yeast
* 2 lemons, juiced
* 3 tablespoon white wine / apple cider vinegar
* 1½ tablespoon dijon mustard
* 2 cloves garlic (crushed)
* 1½ teaspoon sea salt (use less if desired)
* 1 teaspoon oregano (or dried mint or parsley)

## Instructions

Préparation:

1. Press the tofu and cut into slices around ½ inch thick (similar to how you see traditional halloumi sliced). You can press the tofu using plates with something heavy on them or using a tofu press.
2. Put all the ingredients except the tofu into a tupperware or baking dish, and mix well. Ideally something that can be sealed and turned upside down to make sure all the tofu is really well marinded.
3. Next add the tofu. Make sure all the tofu is well covered. If you need extra moisture add a little extra apple cider vinegar or some more lemon juice.
4. Leave the tofu to marinade for at least a few hours, better still overnight. If you have a sealed, water-tight container you can flip it over half way through to make sure the tofu gets evenly marinaded.
5. To cook, heat a griddle pan with some oil. Get it nice and hot, then fry the slices of tofu until they have a little char on them. If there is extra marinade left over either use it for an extra dip or pour it over the frying tofu for extra flavour.
6. Alternatively, place on the BBQ and cook until sizzling & you have lovely griddle marks. You can also oven bake for 25 minutes or until a little crispy.
