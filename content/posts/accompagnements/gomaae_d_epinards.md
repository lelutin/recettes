## Ingrédients

Donne X portions

For the Sauce

* 3 Tbsp toasted white sesame seeds
* 1 Tbsp soy sauce
* 1 Tbsp sugar

For the Spinach

* 1 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt (for blanching)
* 227 g spinach (8 oz, 227 g)

## Notes

* You can keep the leftovers in an airtight container and store in the
  refrigerator for 2–3 days or freezer for 2–4 weeks.

## Instructions

Préparation:

1. Gather all the ingredients. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Prepare a
   large bowl of cold water with ice cubes.

To Make the Sauce

* Even though your sesame seeds are pre-toasted, we will freshly toast them now
  to enhance their nutty aroma. Add 3 Tbsp toasted white sesame seeds to an
  ungreased frying pan and turn on the stove to medium-high heat. Once the pan
  is hot, lift it up and shake it constantly over the flame. Toss and turn over
  the sesame seeds in the pan to evenly toast them. When they are fragrant, turn
  off the heat and move the pan off the stove.
* Transfer the toasted sesame seeds to a mortar (suribachi). Grind them with a
  pestle (surikogi). Leave some seeds whole for texture.
* To the ground sesame seeds, add 1 Tbsp soy sauce and 1 Tbsp sugar and mix it
  all together. Set aside.

To Cook the Spinach

* Once the water is boiling, add 1 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt. Add 227 g
  spinach to the boiling water, stem side first, and cook for 20 seconds, as the
  stems take longer to cook.
* Then, gently push the leafy part into the water and cook for 30–45 seconds.
* Transfer the spinach from the pot and plunge it into the iced bath to stop the
  cooking for 1 minute.

To Assemble

* Once the spinach is cool enough to handle, collect the spinach and squeeze the
  water out. Tip: Do not leave the spinach in the water for too long or else it
  will lose nutrients.
* Cut the spinach into 1-inch (2.5 cm) lengths and put it in the mortar. If your
  mortar is small, transfer the sesame dressing and spinach to a bowl.
* Toss it all together. Serve at room temperature or chilled.
